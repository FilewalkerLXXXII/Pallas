# Pallas beta

Pallas is currently in BETA which mean this README is useless and you are too.

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is having a working copy of Wector and credentials to use it. If you don't have this, kindly leave this forsaken place now.

## Installing

Download this repository using the method of your liking then place the script into the scripts directory at the root of Wector. Optionally rename the Pallas folder from `Pallas-master` to `Pallas` if you cloned the master branch.

After installation the path to Pallas will be `<Wector root>/scripts/Pallas`
