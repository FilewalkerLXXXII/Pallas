# Pallas beta

Currently in BETA!

Pallas is a general purpose PvE behavior script aimed to support all classes and specializations for Wrath of the Lich King Classic. PvP is not officially supported!

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is having a working copy of Wector and credentials to use it. If you don't have this, kindly leave this forsaken place now.

## Installing

Download this repository using the method of your liking then place it into the scripts directory at the root of Wector. Optionally rename the Pallas folder from `Pallas-master` to `Pallas` if you cloned the master branch.

After installation the path to Pallas will be `<Wector root>/scripts/Pallas`
